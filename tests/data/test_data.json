Explore our step-by-step integration guides and learn how to set up your proxies.\nUse ip.oxylabs.io/location to check the parameters of your IPs—this domain delivers information from four geolocation databases: MaxMind, IP2Location, DB-IP, and IPinfo.io.

If your connection fails, obtain a new IP using the same process. For more reliability, use tools that accept hostnames instead of IPs - they automatically connect to the optimal server.\nWe offer pay-per-IP products that connect via hostname and port only. Direct IP connections are not supported. The IP addresses shown in your dashboard are for reference only. For best results, please use third-party tools that support hostname and port connections.\nHowever, if your third party software requires a specific address, we recommend resolving this as follows:\nOpen terminal on your computer\nEnter the command based on product you're using: ping isp.oxylabs.io (for ISP) ping dc.oxylabs.io (for Datacenter) ping ddc.oxylabs.io (for Dedicated Datacenter)\nThe system will provide you with the IP address to input into the third-party tool\nAdditionally, add assigned port number to target specific IP from your proxy list\nThis workaround has limitations: service may become unavailable during maintenance and IPs may change without notice. If your proxies stop working, ping the hostname to get a new IP address or switch to a tool that supports hostnames."
